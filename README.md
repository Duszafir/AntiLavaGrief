This plugin helps prevent griefing with lava and flint-and-steel by notifying server players via chat whenever a player places lava or sets fire to any type of wood plank. If a player attempts to use lava or a flint-and-steel on wooden planks, the plugin will broadcast a message to alert the server about the suspicious activity. Itâ€™s designed to help protect your server from players who may be attempting to burn down structures or grief the environment.

Key features:

Alerts when lava touches wood planks.
Sends a notification when a player uses a flint-and-steel or right-clicks with a lava bucket on wooden planks.
Cooldown when using lava or flint and steel on wooden blocks, preventing abuse.
Very easy-to-use.

IMPORTANT

This plugin does not prevent players from burning wood, instead, every time they do, it sends a notification to the chat and applies a cooldown. Additionally, it logs each attempt in a file for record-keeping.
