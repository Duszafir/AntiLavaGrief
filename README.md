This plugin helps prevent griefing with lava and flint-and-steel by notifying server players via chat whenever a player places lava or sets fire to any type of wood plank. If a player attempts to use lava or a flint-and-steel on wooden planks, the plugin will broadcast a message to alert the server about the suspicious activity. It’s designed to help protect your server from players who may be attempting to burn down structures or grief the environment.

Key features:

Alerts when lava touches wood planks.
Sends a notification when a player uses a flint-and-steel or right-clicks with a lava bucket on wooden planks.
Cooldown when using lava or flint and steel on wooden blocks, preventing abuse.
Very easy-to-use.

/al enable to activate alerts for when lava or flammable items are placed near wooden planks.
