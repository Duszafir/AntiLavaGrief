# AntiLavaGrief
# Minecraft Plugin 1.21.4
AntiLavaGrief alerts server admins when a player places lava or uses flint-and-steel on wooden planks, helping prevent griefing and fire-related damage.

This plugin helps prevent griefing with lava and flint-and-steel by notifying server administrators via chat whenever a player places lava or sets fire to any type of wood plank. If a player attempts to use lava or a flint-and-steel on wooden planks, the plugin will broadcast a message to alert the server about the suspicious activity.
